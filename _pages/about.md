I am a PhD student of Nuclear Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am interested in Nuclear Reactor Physics and Analysis, Reactor Diagnostics, and Power Reactor Noise Analysis. Apart of studying, I am eager to extend my research experience in multiphysics analysis area.

I start my PhD program on Fall 2021 with research assistantship. Besides my academic pursuit, I am interest in nuclear energy policy and advocacy. I host a podcast called [Bicara Nuklir](https://open.spotify.com/show/7Ccn9sv462INHxCBosDr6v?si=ba4beda6aa3c4552), which means "Talking about Nuclear" in English. As the title suggests, Bicara Nuklir is a podcast talking about nuclear energy and technology. Started in March 2020, Bicara Nuklir has had more than 70 episodes and 2700 streams.

Along with my 3 partners, I am also building a nuclear energy and technology think tank called Siwabessy Initiative, referencing to the name of the largest research reactor in Indonesia that is operated by the National Nuclear Agency of Indonesia. Through Siwabessy Initiative, we aim to advocate, disseminate, and innovate in nuclear energy and technology in Indonesia.

## Research Areas
My research areas including, but not limited to:
- Advanced Reactor Design and Analysis
  - Monte Carlo Simulation of High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGR)
  - Two-step method using diffusion approximation for reactor safety analysis
- Reactor Diagnostics and Reactor Noise Analysis
  - Power reactor noise analysis and its application for advanced reactor diagnostics
  - Computational tools and method for power reactor noise analysis
- Nuclear Code Development
  - Code development for solving eigenvalue, adjoint, noise, and sensitivity analysis
