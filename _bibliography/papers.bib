	abstract = {COVID-19 has disrupted all aspects of human life. To mitigate the impact of the pandemic, several efforts have been taken, including by Indonesian scholars abroad. This book entitled Indonesia Post-Pandemic Recovery Outlook: Strategy towards Net-Zero Emissions by 2060 from the Renewables and Carbon-Neutral Energy Perspectives explores energy sustainability and climate change issues and how it can progress further. There are also discussion on the delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic to a few major renewable energy projects that should have been done in 2020-2021. Comprising of 14 chapters, this book is divided into three sections. The first part, Indonesia's Current Position and Strategy for Renewable Energy, explores Indonesia's current position and strategy on New and Renewable Energy. This chapter also explores Indonesia's commitment towards Net-Zero Carbon Emission 2060. Second, Carbon-Free and Renewable Energy in Indonesia, discusses the status of renewable energy use in the world, elaborate on the carbon impact of energy shift from fossil to renewable sources, and introduce a new criterion in renewable energy: carbon-neutral energy. The last part, Indonesia's New Strategy to Achieve Net-Zero Emission in 2060, explores the macroeconomic benefits of renewable and carbon-neutral energy deployment which are increasing energy security, fueling GDP development, creating job opportunities, enhancing human welfare, and achieving gender equality. We hope that this book can be a valuable reference for stakeholders, policymakers, as well as society to recover from the pandemic crisis and find better solutions to benefit future generations.},

	abstract = {Diffusion approximation is an important approximation used to model a nuclear reactor core with a quite good accuracy and less computational cost. This approximation has been used widely around the globe for various kinds of nuclear reactors. This diffusion approximation is applied in a two-step method, a method combining a high fidelity transport code and low fidelity diffusion code. Meanwhile, innovations in the nuclear core model continue to make the nuclear reactor core safer, more robust, and smaller. The trend of creating smaller and more modular reactor core is emerging in the last ten years. These innovations will affect the core modeling system. Consequently, for smaller reactors, it is important to evaluate the capability of diffusion approximation if one wants to use a computationally cheaper method to model the reactor core. In this paper, neutron diffusion calculation for 160 MWth integral pressurized water reactor (IPWR) core was conducted using the PARCS nodal diffusion code employing the few-group spatially homogenized cross-sections generated by the Serpent Monte Carlo code. Due to its capability to model any reactor geometry in the high-resolution calculation, the results from Serpent were also used as a reference. Two important parameters are compared between PARCS and Serpent: effective neutron multiplication factor and core power distribution. For the full IPWR core model, a discrepancy of 564 pcm between PARCS and Serpent keff was observed, while the radial power distribution had a maximum error of 4.71 \%. It can be said, to some extent, that the diffusion approximation can be applied to IPWR core analysis. However, further improvement is indeed required if one wants more accurate results with low computational costs.},

	abstract = {CORE DESIGN PARAMETRIC STUDY OF INTEGRAL PRESSURIZED WATER REACTOR (IPWR) WITH MIXED OXIDE CERAMIC FUEL USING SRAC CODE SYSTEM. Integral PWR using MOX fuel can be used as solution to handle electrification problem in archipelagic nations as well as to accomodate the transition of fuel from UO2 to MOX. Integral PWR is a modular nuclear power plant with 160 MWt for each module. Recently, Integral PWR use UO2 fuel as the main fuel. This researchâ€™s purpose is to determine the change of reactor core performance from UO2 into MOX. This research is done by varying PuO2 ratio in MOX, number of fuel, and type of fuel cladding using SRAC2006 code system. Parametric study is done by observing value of keff, conversion ratio, and actinide inventory, as well as by comparing with UO2 fuel reactor core. Result shows that performance of reactor core using MOX is better than UO2 reactor core. The most optimum design of Integral PWR is using 12\% PuO2 in MOX fuel, core diameter 165 cm, and Zircalloy-4 cladding. This can be observed from period of criticality of reactor core up to 1521 days with lowest CR is 0,622004. Excess reactivity of this reactor core is lower than UO2 fuel design (1,07745932 compared with 1,1035821). Actinide produced by this core shows declining trend during reactor operation.},

	abstract = {The significant recent advances in computer speed and memory have made possible an increasing fidelity and accuracy in reactor core simulation with minimal increase in the computational burden. This has been important for modeling some of the smaller advanced reactor designs for which simplified approximations such as few groups homogenized diffusion theory are not as accurate as they were for large light water reactor cores. For narrow cylindrical cores with large surface to volume ratios such the Ped Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR), neutron leakage from the core can be significant, particularly with the harder neutron spectrum and longer mean free path than a light water reactor. In this paper the core from the OECD PBMR-400 benchmark was analyzed using multigroup Monte Carlo cross sections in the HTR reactor core simulation code AGREE. Homogenized cross sections were generated for each of the discrete regions of the AGREE model using a full core SERPENT Monte Carlo model. The cross sections were generated for a variety of group structures in AGREE to assess the importance of finer group discretization on the accuracy of the core eigenvalue and flux predictions compared to the SERPENT full core Monte Carlo solution. A significant increase in the accuracy was observed by increasing the number of energy groups, with as much as a 530 pcm improvement in the eigenvalue calculation when increasing the number of energy groups from 2 to 14. Significant improvements were also observed in the AGREE neutron flux distributions compared to the SERPENT full core calculation.},
