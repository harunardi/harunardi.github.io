    - name: Summary
      value: Harun is a PhD student at the Department of Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) specialized in nuclear reactor physics and analysis. He is part of Analysis of Reactor Transient and Stability (ARTS) group at UIUC supervised by Prof. Tomasz Kozlowski. Along the years, he has involved in some projects related to nuclear reactor physics of advanced reactor, high-performance computing, analysis and method development. In his PhD research, he focuses on power reactor diagnostics and noise analysis for advanced reactor application. Aside his academic pursuit, he is also involved in energy policy activism in his home country of Indonesia. He is currently building a nuclear technology think-tank “Siwabessy Initiative” with his partners.

#        In this project, we propose to combine new air-coupled ultrasound transducers with hyperbolic metamaterials to design vision systems that exceed the imaging capabilities of traditional systems. We will investigate the application of acoustic hyperlenses in the biomedical context to image beyond the diffraction limit, enabling imaging with deep sub-wavelength resolution. In addition, we will investigate the capabilities of air-coupled chiral hyperlenses and Bessel beams to manipulate objects, aiming to efficiently trap, move and rotate microparticles on the subwavelength scale. The results of this project could have a wide application in biomedical applications but also in agri-food and industrial applications.
